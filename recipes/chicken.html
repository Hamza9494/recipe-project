    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This was a recipe I thought of while trying to figure out what to do with
      some apples that were getting too ripe. I love this recipe and I hope you
      do too!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>Â½ pound bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Combine red vinegar and brown sugar in a saucepan; cover and bring to a
        boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sugar is dissolved and mixture is
        slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bacon until crisp,
        adding 3 dashes liquid smoke while cooking, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer
        bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and drain bacon grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place potatoes, skin-side down, in a baking dish. Drizzle 1 tablespoon
        olive oil over potatoes and season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken on a serving plate and top with apple mixture. Arrange
        potatoes alongside chicken.
      </li>
